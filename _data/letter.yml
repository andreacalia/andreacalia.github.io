  Dear,

  my name is Andrea Calia and I am a passionate Computer Engineer. I enjoy crafting beautiful Software systems and learning from it.

  I particularly like working with Java, Python and JavaScript. They are great languages and they recently got significant updates and is fun to explore the functionalities, especially how they apply to my day-to-day work.

  I currently work at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) and I take care of operational Software for the LHC (the Large Hadron Collider). I love this work because I can learn how a particle accelerator works and working with physicist is particularly inspiring!

  Feel free to contact me in any way you like :)

  I wish you a great day, do not forget to smile.

  Kind regards,

  Andrea Calia
